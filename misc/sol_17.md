## 17. Trees can be implemented either using linked list or array. What is the first thing you consider when you choose either of the option for your problem

Factors:

1. Dense/sparse (memory efficiency)
    - dense: array
    - sparse: linkedlist
1. Required/supported operations
    - frequent insert: linkedlist
    - frequent delete: linkedlist
    - frequent search: array/linkedlist
1. Size (upper limit): fixed/dynamic
